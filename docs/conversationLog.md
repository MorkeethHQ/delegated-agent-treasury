# Conversation Log — Human-Agent Collaboration

## Project
Open Bound Onchain Money Maker — yield-only spending for AI agents, backed by wstETH on Base.

## Participants
- **Oscar** (human) — architect, orchestrator, funder
- **Bagel** (AI agent, Cursor) — contract developer, deployment, core flow
- **Claude Code** (AI agent, CLI) — approval backend, policy engine, MCP server, CLI, docs

## Timeline

### Day 1 — Direction & Architecture

**Oscar → Both agents:** "I'm building for the Synthesis hackathon with my bot Bagel. What can we do?"

**Division of labor established:**
- Bagel: core flow, contract deployment, integration
- Claude Code: approvals backend, CLI, docs/demo polish

**Key decisions:**
- Oscar killed the web UI: "Can we make it human AND agent compatible without a web UI?" Both agents agreed — CLI + skill.md + MCP is more aligned with hackathon ethos (judges are AI agents).
- Chain: Base Sepolia for demo, with production path to Base mainnet.
- Focus: "Keep it brutally simple. One clean demo path, not feature breadth."

### Day 1 — Core Build

**Claude Code built (autonomously):**
- Policy engine with 12 unit tests (agent match, caps, thresholds, allow/deny lists)
- Approval store with file persistence
- REST API: 8 endpoints (health, evaluate, approvals, respond, audit, policy, treasury)
- CLI: 9 commands (health, policy, evaluate, approvals, approve, deny, audit, treasury, demo)
- Audit logger (append-only JSONL)
- skill.md for agent-callable interface

**Bagel built (autonomously):**
- AgentTreasury.sol — wstETH treasury with yield-only spending, recipient whitelist, per-tx cap
- MockWstETH.sol — testnet mock with simulateYield()
- Deployed both to Base Sepolia

**Oscar relayed** contract addresses from Bagel to Claude Code. Claude Code wired up the executor (viem integration layer).

### Day 1 — Integration Point

**Bagel → Oscar:** "We're at the real integration point. Next: mint, deposit, set agent."

**Oscar → Both:** "Plan locked: Bagel does treasury config, Claude does small E2E immediately after."

### Day 2 — MCP Server & Bounty Strategy

**Oscar:** "Go ahead on the MCP task."

**Claude Code built the Lido MCP server in ~10 minutes** (estimated 8 hours). 11 tools covering treasury operations, Lido staking (stake, wrap, unwrap, withdraw), balance/rate queries, protocol stats, and governance proposals. All write operations support dry_run simulation. Thin wrapper on existing executor — most of the work was already done.

**Oscar:** "Funny you said it would take 8 hours but you did it in 10 minutes."

**Bounty research:** Claude Code analyzed all 46 hackathon bounties. Identified 3 realistic targets:
- Lido stETH Agent Treasury
- Lido MCP Server
- Synthesis Open Track

### Day 2 — Innovation Push

**Oscar:** "Are there ways to make this more innovative?"

**Claude Code identified:**
1. Base mainnet deployment (real wstETH, real yield)
2. ERC-8004 on-chain agent identity

**Oscar:** "I love it. I can fund Base mainnet." Sent ETH to Base mainnet and messaged Bagel to deploy.

### Day 2 — Polish & Audit

**Claude Code (autonomously):**
- Dual-chain support (RPC_URL env var, .env.example with both configs)
- Fixed missing `await` on async approval store calls (bug caught during build)
- Mainnet placeholders across all docs for instant-patch
- Three pitch variants (30s, 2min, 5min)
- Submission copy
- Judge demo script
- Story narrative ("An Agent With a Wallet")
- Governance tool for Lido MCP bounty requirement
- Full self-audit as agent judge (20 issues found, all critical ones fixed)

### Day 3 — Registration, Verification, Submission Prep

**Claude Code registered the ERC-8004 agent identity** on Base mainnet via the Devfolio API. Three API calls: init → email OTP verification (Oscar provided the code) → complete. On-chain tx confirmed: `0x4027641718bb5cfb9fdf7f4871f6506685b5367cab1a3a030b9bb0fe779ee934`.

**Full judge demo dry-run:** Started the API server, ran all 5 policy paths via curl:
- Small amount → auto-approved
- Large amount → approval_required → human approves → executed
- Blocked destination → denied with reason
- Audit trail captured all 8 events

Found and fixed a zsh compatibility bug in the demo script (brace expansion broke JSON args).

**Track verification:** Claude Code fetched all 46 track descriptions from the Devfolio catalog API and checked requirements against our project. Result:
- **Dropped 2 tracks** — "Agents that Pay" requires live GMX perps trading on Arbitrum; "Agent Services on Base" requires x402 payment integration. Neither fits.
- **Kept 4** — Lido Treasury (strong), Lido MCP (strong), Open Track (universal), ERC-8004 Receipts (partial, added `agent.json` + `agent_log.json` to qualify).

**Oscar:** "No more scope expansion. Focused on mainnet deploy + ERC-8004 registration."

**Claude Code:** Locked in patch/verify mode. Submission script prepped with correct 4 track UUIDs. All placeholders ready for instant replacement. Waiting on Bagel's mainnet treasury address.

## Collaboration Model

Oscar never wrote code. He wrote intent, made strategic decisions, and funded deployment. The two AI agents worked autonomously within their domains, communicating through a shared Git repo with Oscar as the message bus.

```
Oscar decides direction
    ├── tells Bagel: "deploy AgentTreasury on Base Sepolia"
    │       └── Bagel deploys, returns addresses
    ├── tells Claude: "wire up the executor to these addresses"
    │       └── Claude builds integration, CLI, tests
    └── reviews both, resolves conflicts, pushes forward
```

## Session 3: E2E + Autonomous Agent Loop

**Oscar:** "Bagel finished Sepolia config. Run the E2E."

**Claude Code:** Fixed bigint serialization bug in API server, ran full E2E against live Sepolia treasury. Policy engine: all 5 paths pass. On-chain spend: 0.005 wstETH successfully spent via executor. TX: `0x1fd5edb8...`.

**Oscar:** "What would a minimal orchestration loop look like? More autonomy?"

**Claude Code:** Proposed governance-aware autonomous agent loop — 80 lines of TypeScript, monitors treasury + Lido governance, fuses signals into spend/hold decisions, all bounded by the policy engine.

**Oscar:** "Let's do it! I love it"

**Claude Code:** Built `apps/agent-loop` — autonomous daemon that:
1. Checks treasury state (available yield)
2. Queries Lido governance (active Snapshot proposals)
3. Holds spending if risky governance detected (upgrades, parameter changes, emergencies)
4. Submits spend plans through the policy engine when conditions are safe
5. All decisions are audit-logged and policy-bounded

**Bagel's rating:** 8/10 overall. "Not just 'good enough' — actually good."

### Session 4: Chainlink Oracle Pivot & Mainnet Funding

**Oscar:** "Bagel tried to transfer wstETH to the treasury but `stEthPerToken()` reverts on Base."

**Claude Code:** Researched and confirmed — wstETH on Base is `ERC20BridgedPermit` via OP Stack canonical bridge. No rate functions. Identified Chainlink oracle `0xB88BAc61a4Ca37C43a3725912B1f472c9A5bc061` (wstETH/stETH, 18 decimals, 24h heartbeat) as the solution.

**Oscar → Bagel:** "Redeploy with Chainlink oracle instead of `stEthPerToken()`."

**Bagel:** Redeployed AgentTreasury to Base mainnet: `0x455d76a24e862a8d552a0722823ac4d13e482426`. Deploy TX: `0x33e648434ce963eb47ddfb403df14f2faae20d72e78bf0e9ebafefa3e85ea0db`.

**Oscar:** Funded and configured the treasury:
- Deposited 0.003792746035366772 wstETH
- Set agent address
- Whitelisted recipient (0xdead)
- Set per-tx cap (0.0001 wstETH)

**Claude Code:** Patched new mainnet address across all 12 files. Updated Solidity source and Standard JSON Input for Chainlink oracle version. Updated story, docs, artifacts.

## Key Pivots

1. **Web UI → CLI + skill.md + MCP** — Oscar's call. Right decision for agent-native judges.
2. **Testnet only → Dual-chain** — Claude identified mainnet as innovation differentiator. Oscar funded it.
3. **ERC-8004 identity** — Discovered mid-hackathon. Not in original scope but adds verifiable on-chain agent identity.
4. **Governance tool** — Added after bounty audit revealed it was a hard requirement for the Lido MCP track.
5. **Autonomous agent loop** — Added to transform from permission layer into actual autonomous agent with governance awareness.
6. **Chainlink oracle pivot** — L2 wstETH doesn't expose `stEthPerToken()`. Redeployed with Chainlink price feed. Real L2 engineering problem solved under pressure.

## Artifacts

### Session 5: Phase 2 & 3 — From Treasury to Platform (2026-03-20)

With 60 hours remaining, Oscar pivoted from closing to building. Three parallel Claude Code agents ran overnight batch work while Oscar orchestrated.

**Yield Strategy Engine:**
- Multi-bucket distribution: operations 40%, grants 30%, reserve 30%
- Configurable thresholds and per-tx clamping per bucket
- Preview endpoint for dry-run distribution planning
- New `packages/yield-strategy` package

**ERC-8004 Trust-Gated Payments:**
- Before paying any recipient, policy engine verifies on-chain agent identity in ERC-8004 registry
- Unverified recipients escalate to human approval automatically
- Turned ERC-8004 from "identity badge" to "active security layer"
- New `/verify/:address` API endpoint

**Uniswap Yield Trading (GMX → Uniswap pivot):**
- Original plan: GMX perps on Arbitrum (required by "Agents that Pay" track)
- Pivot: Uniswap V3 swaps on Base — same chain as treasury, no bridging
- DCA into USDC, swap to WETH, rebalance into cbETH — all policy-gated
- Live quotes confirmed: 0.01 wstETH ≈ $26.58 USDC
- New `packages/uniswap-engine` package with quote + execute
- New `/swap/quote` and `/swap/execute` API endpoints

**x402 Payment Gateway:**
- Treasury became a payable service via Coinbase's x402 protocol
- Other agents pay USDC per API call: swap quotes $0.01, execution $0.05
- New `packages/x402-gateway` package
- Re-qualifies for "Agents that Pay" and "Agent Services on Base" tracks (previously dropped)

**Swap Policy Controls:**
- Bagel designed separate risk controls for swaps vs transfers
- `maxSwapPerAction` and `maxSlippageBps` operate independently from transfer caps
- Policy engine now distinguishes action types (transfer vs swap)

**Overnight batch (3 parallel agents):**
- Agent 1: Uniswap engine + swap routes
- Agent 2: Yield strategy engine + bucket distribution
- Agent 3: x402 gateway + ERC-8004 trust verification
- Oscar coordinated merges and resolved conflicts between agents

**Oscar:** "The system grew from 6 packages to 9, from 11 MCP tools to 18, from 8 API endpoints to 16."

**Updated artifacts:**
- 9 packages in monorepo
- 18 MCP tools
- 16 API endpoints
- 6 bounty tracks targeted (up from 4)
- Demo script expanded from 5 steps to 12 steps
- Project thesis: "A treasury agent that protects principal and autonomously deploys only accrued yield into bounded strategies."
